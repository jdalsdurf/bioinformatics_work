Performing a de novo assembly of the PRRSV (Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus) genome using Illumina data with SPAdes and Pilon involves several steps. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to do this in a Linux environment:

**1. Data Preparation:**

- Obtain your Illumina sequencing data for the PRRSV genome. Ensure you have paired-end Illumina reads (R1 and R2 files) in FASTQ format.

**2. Install Required Software:**

- Make sure you have SPAdes and Pilon installed. You can install them using package managers or by following their official installation instructions.

**3. Hybrid Assembly with SPAdes:**

Navigate to the directory containing your Illumina data and execute the following SPAdes command to perform a hybrid assembly:

```bash
spades.py -1 R1.fastq -2 R2.fastq --careful --only-assembler -o spades_output_directory
```

- Replace `R1.fastq` and `R2.fastq` with the filenames of your Illumina reads.
- The `--careful` flag makes SPAdes more conservative in error correction, which is essential for viral genomes.
- The `--only-assembler` flag tells SPAdes to only perform the assembly step.

**4. Polishing with Pilon:**

After the SPAdes assembly is complete, you can further improve the assembly quality using Pilon. Navigate to the SPAdes output directory:

```bash
cd spades_output_directory
```

Run Pilon to polish the assembly with your Illumina reads:

```bash
pilon --genome scaffolds.fasta --frags R1.fastq --frags R2.fastq --output pilon_output_directory
```

- Replace `scaffolds.fasta` with the name of the assembly file generated by SPAdes.
- `R1.fastq` and `R2.fastq` are your Illumina reads.
- The `--output` flag specifies the directory where Pilon will store the polished assembly.

**5. Analyze the Polished Assembly:**

Once Pilon has finished, you can find the polished assembly in the `pilon_output_directory`. The improved assembly will be in the `pilon.fasta` file. You can analyze and use this polished assembly for further downstream analysis.

Please note that this process assumes a relatively small genome size for PRRSV. For larger genomes, such as those of some eukaryotic organisms, additional considerations and parameters may be necessary.

Also, ensure that you have the necessary computing resources (CPU, RAM, and storage) for assembling and polishing, especially if the genome is large or complex.
